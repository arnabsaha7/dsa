## üìñ Overview

Binary trees are foundational data structures in computer science, essential to algorithms and applications. This folder is dedicated to exploring various aspects of binary trees through coding problems and solution walkthroughs. Problems range from calculating tree height, traversals, and node insertion to more advanced tasks like balancing trees and performing transformations.

Each problem is organized to help users:
- **Understand** the problem statement.
- **Follow** the code solution step-by-step.
- **Visualize** the process with GIF animations (where applicable).
